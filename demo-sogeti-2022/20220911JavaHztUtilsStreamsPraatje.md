### Title:

- Streams. The power of being lazy: Exploring streams by writing my own implentation of Kotlin Sequences in Java
- Streams it's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness

---

### Description

The good old Streams api has been around in Java since 2014. Streams provide a clean and efficient way to process data.

There is even the option to process computationally intensive code in parallel using streams!

But they can also be a bit mistifying when you start working with them. What makes them efficient?

What is the difference between an intermediate and terminal operation and how is parallel execution achieved?

Going through the source code of streams reveales a complicated mechanism.
Spliterators and ForkJoinPools are some of the terms you come across when going though the implementation.

All this complexity hides some of the essence that make up a stream pipeline.
What even is a Spliterator, what makes it different from an Iterator and what is it used for?

Using kotlin sequences and my own implementation of a sequeunce in java, I will explore the key mechanism of streams.

Let me take you on my journey of discovery in the world of streams and sequences using live code demo's and concrete
examples.

Sit back, enjoy and let's get lazy.
