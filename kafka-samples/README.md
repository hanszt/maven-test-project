# Kafka Streams

---

Working with data in motion means working with Apache Kafka®. 
First developed at LinkedIn by the founders of Confluent, 
Kafka is a distributed event streaming technology leveraged by over 70% of the
Fortune 500 and capable of handling trillions of events a day. 
Confluent provides a platform for data in motion built around Kafka that is cloud-native, 
complete, and available everywhere it’s needed.
